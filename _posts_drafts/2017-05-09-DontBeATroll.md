Once of the key issues raging in public policy discourse discussions in 
the United States is *climate change*. Is the planet warming up because of increased 
CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere from human activity and energy use? 

This is a contentious question despite a groundswell of public support amongst 
progressives, combined with a broad consensus over the majority of scientists working in the discipline. Most 
researchers either explicitly or implicitly agree that this is indeed the case:
the global temperature is increasing directly because of increased levels of 
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere (most likely caused by human energy use). 
Broad literature reviews generally confirm this point of view and even large scale 
organizations that enjoy widespread public trust such as NASA agree full-throatedly
that climate change poses a serious threat to humanity as a whole. 

But there is also a powerful counter-movement at play within conservative circles: 
*climate skepticism*. Proponents of this position claim that the science is *not* 
settled, that potential risks of climate change to humanity are being unnecessary 
amplified by liberals for political gain and that numerous details in the published
account don't add up. Conservative bloggers attempt to 'debunk' published studies 
with a wide range of counter arguments ranging from honing in on small scale anomalies,
personal or broad-based *ad-hominim* attacks against climate scientists or climate 
activists and the general use of misinformation to bombard opponents with assertions of 
facts to simply wear them down and silence them. These argumentation tactics could 
commonly be described as 'trolling' and can quite effective at convincing 
observers that their arguments are better. Put simply, these tactics work very well.  

The important issue here is that the debate being carried out on social media, on the 
news and in the public eye generally is not based on scientific norms for understanding 
how phenomena work. Scientific discussions are typically based on *abductive reasoning*: 
argument from evidence to the best available explanation. In the blood sport where 
teams of trolls strive to defeat their opponents by any means necessary, the meagre 
weapons of abductive reasoning can do little to withstand the assault of scorn, derision, 
and (for want of a better word) bullshit. 

But, knowledge is power. *Science is, after all, very much like magic.* Science is the basis 
for technology, and try as they might, trolls cannot actually do anything. They can sway 
public opinion, but they cannot cure disease or prevent natural disasters. They cannot 
send ships into space or understand the mysteries of fluid dynamics in the upper 
stratosphere. 
 
So, in order to fight the trolls, we must enable the explanatory power of scientific 
knowledge to address these counter-arguments as explicitly and powerfully as possible. 
We must become wizards.
