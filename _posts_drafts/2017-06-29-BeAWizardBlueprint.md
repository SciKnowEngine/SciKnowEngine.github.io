In an earlier post (['Don't be a troll, be a Wizard!'](/2017/05/19/DontBeATroll.html)), I describe a 
somewhat sprawling vision of how to counter science denialism by casting the confrontation between science 
advocates and denialists as an epic battle between 'Wizards' and 'Trolls'. Here, I develop a 
more concrete proposal for a research project to deliver on that vision.
