Once of the key issues raging in public policy discourse discussions in 
the United States is *climate change*. Is the planet warming up because of increased 
CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere from human activity and energy use? 

This is a contentious question despite a groundswell of public support amongst 
progressives, combined with a broad consensus over the majority of scientists working in 
the discipline. Most researchers either explicitly or implicitly agree that this is 
indeed the case: the global temperature is increasing directly because of increased 
levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere (most likely caused by human energy use). 
Broad literature reviews generally confirm this point of view and even large scale 
organizations that enjoy widespread public trust such as NASA agree full-throatedly
that climate change poses a serious threat to humanity as a whole. 

But there is also a powerful counter-movement at play within conservative circles: 
*climate skepticism*. Proponents of this position claim that the science is *not* 
settled, that potential risks of climate change to humanity are being unnecessary 
amplified by liberals for political gain and that numerous details in the published
account don't add up. Conservative bloggers attempt to 'debunk' published studies 
with a wide range of counter arguments ranging from honing in on small scale anomalies,
personal or broad-based *ad-hominim* attacks against climate scientists or climate 
activists and the general use of misinformation to bombard opponents with assertions of 
facts to simply wear them down and silence them. These argumentation tactics could 
commonly be described as 'trolling' and can quite effective at convincing 
observers that their arguments are better. Put simply, these tactics work very well.  

The important issue here is that the debate being carried out on social media, on the 
news and in the public eye generally is not based on scientific norms for understanding 
how phenomena work. Scientific discussions are typically based on *abductive reasoning*: 
argument from evidence to the best available explanation. In the blood sport where 
teams of trolls strive to defeat their opponents by any means necessary, the meagre 
weapons of abductive reasoning can do little to withstand the assault of scorn, derision, 
and bullshit (a word that we use here based on [a precise technical defintion](https://www.stoa.org.uk/topics/bullshit/pdf/on-bullshit.pdf)). 

But, knowledge is power. *Science is, after all, very much like magic.* Science is the basis 
for technology, and try as they might, trolls cannot accomplish anything remotely as powerful. 
They can sway public opinion, but they cannot cure disease or prevent natural disasters. 
They cannot send ships into space or understand the mysteries of fluid dynamics in the upper 
stratosphere. 
 
We must enable the explanatory power of scientific 
knowledge to address these counter-arguments as explicitly and powerfully as possible. 
At present, the scientific community does not possess the necessary power to challenge the trolls. 
This is was best said by Ben Goldacre in the last chapter of his book '[Bad Science: Quacks, Hacks, 
and Big Pharma Flacks](https://books.google.com/books?id=rDT9MO0r0UYC&lpg=PP1&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false)'. He writes:

> *To anyone who feels their ideas have been challenged by this book or who has been made 
angry by it - to the people who feature in it, I suppose - I would say this: you win. You really 
do. I would hope that there might be room for you to reconsider, to change your stancein 
the light of what might be new information (as I will happily do, if there is ever an opportunity 
to update this book). But you will not need to because, as we both know, you collectively have 
almost full spectrum dominance. Your ideas - bogus though they may be - have immense superficial
plausibility, they can be expressed rapidly, they are endlessly repeated, and they are believed 
by enough people for you to make very comfortable livings and to have enormous cultural influence.
You win.*

Personally, I am not comfortable with this easy capitulation. 

Let's start acting a little more like this guy:

Countering the troll 'full spectrum dominance' will require the development of 
transformative approaches to remove barriers that laypeople experience in 
understanding complex scientific concepts. We will need to make the work more 
inclusive and more democratic. We may need to transform the way scientists work 
and the way science is taught. This will require impeccability, creativity, 
honesty, and courage. 

So, here are some observations and strategies to consider going forward. 

Technologically, we live in interesting times. On the one hand, social 
media technology tends to drive political discourse to be more polarized and 
insular; 'astroturfing' bots manipulate popular opinion on Twitter with incendiary, ill-informed 
talking points; its relatively easy to drown out informative scientific by spreading 
misinformation in coordinated online media campaigns. 

On the other hand, the underlying advances in data analytics and information science 
that are responsible for thare mean that we

conversations on Twitter automated methods of driving

1. We must not adopt the methods of our adversaries. Creating an expedient,
simple talking point that can be easily discredited damages any claim that we 
have for legitimacy. An example of this is the often-quoted 'climate consensus' 
figure that 97% of published papers in the field agree that "the Earth is 
warming up and human emissions of greenhouse gases are the main cause." 
[ref: Cook et al 2014](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/024024/pdf)'.
Even a simple review of this study's own data 
(['a climate falsehood you can check yourself'](http://daviddfriedman.blogspot.com/2014/02/a-climate-falsehood-you-can-check-for.html)) 
reveals vulnerabilities in the study that should caution us from using that argument. 
2. The

offers an effective way of talking about uncomfortable and pressing problems 
we face in the press. Such an approach could work well for applying scientific 
methods to policy. 
3. 
3. Improve and develop multimedia-driven presentations of scientific knowledge (and link well-
founded scientific claims to evidence in a way that is compelling to lay people).
4. Directly counter the trolls by understanding, unpacking and attacking their arguments. 

At present, the way scientists attempt to construct emphatic and definitive arguments to support
well-informed positions are quite weak since the knowledge needed to draw correct
conclustions is complex and involved. Attempts to simplify or circumvent this complexity 
are areFor example, a widely cited talking point amongst 
liberals in the climate change debate is 
[the review paper by Cook *et al.* published in 2014](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/024024/pdf). 
The authors of this paper performed a catch-all search query across the published literature to 
find as many papers about 'global climate change' or 'global warming' as they could. They retrieved 
11,944 references to published papers and then read and scored each paper's abstract summary 
paragraph to evaluate the authors' position on whether they thought climate change was real. 
They boldly state the following in their paper:

> "Among self-rated papers expressing a position on AGW (anthropogenic global warming), 97.2% endorsed the consensus"

This seemingly compelling figure was widely cited amongst climate change proponents, including 
John Kerry from the bully pulpit of the US Secretary of State. Unfortunately, the underlying work
has been criticized and undercut even from a cursory examination. For example, Joseph Bast and
Roy Spencer attack this figure in [an article in the Wall Street Journal.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/joseph-bast-and-roy-spencer-the-myth-of-the-climate-change-97-1401145980). 
In the right wing denialist blogosphere, the dissenting voices are louder 
and more strident (see [this site]() for an example). , 'fact bombardment' and any sortFor example, the PragerU website posted a video that presented a 
nonsensical argument presented as [an audiovisual presentation](https://www.facebook.com/prageru/videos/1355076144535238/?fref=mentions)
that indirectly cites a blog post with the title ['a climate falsehood you can check 
yourself'](http://daviddfriedman.blogspot.com/2014/02/a-climate-falsehood-you-can-check-for.html).  

This narrative cannot and should not be easily dismissed without a more detailed 
consideration. These skeptics basically re-examined the data from the Cook et 
al. 2014 paper and highlighted that only 1.6% of papers in the study state that
the Earth is warming up and human emissions of greenhouse gases are the main cause.
Beyond the informal criticisms leveled at the study from blogs, several academic papers
have been written that criticize the Cook *et al.* 2014 paper:
