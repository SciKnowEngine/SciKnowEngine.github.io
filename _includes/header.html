    <h1>Systems Biology KEfED Systems</h1>
    <p>The 'Knowledge Engineering from Experimental Design' (KEfED) model is a design approach
 for scientific knowledge representation based on focussing primarily on the variables 
 that are set and observed within an experiment. Within this project, we specfically model the data structure 
 based 'observables' within systems biology studies, which typically consist of many, small experiments, and our 
 work is based on the idea of developing a library of experimental motifs that may be composed together to represent
 the scientific observations generated within a systems biology study.
