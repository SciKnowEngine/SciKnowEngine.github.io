Can science save the world? 

Once of the key issues raging in public policy discourse discussions in 
the United States is **climate change**. Is the planet warming up because of increased 
CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere from human activity and energy use? 

This is a contentious question despite a groundswell of public support amongst 
progressives, and the majority of scientists working in the discipline. Most 
researchers either explicitly or implicitly agree that this is indeed the case:
the global temperature is increasing directly because of increased levels of 
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere (most likely caused by human energy use).

But there is also a powerful counter-movement at play within conservative circles.
